Display the board:
On every frame, display each square in alternating dark and light colors.
Alternate colors on each square, until you get to the next row, which you will then use the same color as the last color from the previous row.
So, once the iteration-1 is equal to the number of collums, make sure to set the next color to the current color, rather than the other color.
All the squares will be added to an array with their proper coordinates and colors, this will all be done upon initialization, to save resources.
Each square will be given it's coordinate in reference to the board - essentially, a squares coord to be blitted at will be its x, y + board x, y
